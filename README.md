### About me
Hi, I’m Ledian Leka. I’m a creative thinker with a bit of a restless mind, always seeking new challenges.
<be>
In late 2020, life led me to the world of ERP systems, where I discovered Business Central and Navision. With a background in a different technology, it was like starting from scratch, but that was exactly the thrill I needed. What began as a daunting challenge quickly became my passion, and I’ve been on a journey of learning and growth ever since.

<div> Thus began my career as a "Business Central programmer"

<!-- ### Project
In the middle of 2022 I start to create my project called "Beerness Central" the idea is that it starts at the end of said year.
<br>
I would love to be able to organize a technical community driven by passion, where we meet people with the same interests, tell our story in BC, successes, failures, etc. If with that we can add value to other people, it is what we take with us.
Being able to receive and give positive/constructive feedback in a friendly environment.
