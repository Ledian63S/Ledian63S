### About me
Hello, my name is Ledian Leka,
<br>
I consider myself a creative, correct, scattered and restless person.
<br> 
At the end of 2018, due to things in life, I got to know the immense world of ERP, until then I had not heard anything about Navinson/business Central or its history.
Although I had programmed for a year and a half in another technology in my previous job, everything was new to me.
I found myself with a huge wall, so many concepts, so much theory and so much world to discover.


<div> Thus began my career as a "Business Central programmer"

### Project
In the middle of 2022 I start to create my project called "Beerness Central" the idea is that it starts at the end of said year.
<br>
I would love to be able to organize a technical community driven by passion, where we meet people with the same interests, tell our story in BC, successes, failures, etc. If with that we can add value to other people, it is what we take with us.
Being able to receive and give positive/constructive feedback in a friendly environment.
